# Challenge: Scissor-Stone-Paper (work in progress)

Implement the game "Scissors-Rock-Paper" in Ruby. The version is irrelevant and therefore freely selectable. 
 
- The game can be realized in two variants, whereby the choice of the variant is left to you: 

  * In variant 1 there are the game elements "scissors", " rock" and "paper", whereby each element exactly has one weakness and strength.
  * In variant 2 there can be as many game elements as you like. The elements can also have more than one weakness and strength. 
  
- At the beginning of the game, the user should select one of the following game elements 
- The opponent's game element shall be chosen at random 
- It should also be displayed how the game ended 
- Theoretically, an infinite number of games can be played one after another 

Setup:
- checkout/download project
- make sure to have ruby installed on your machine (developed with ruby v 2.5.1)
- cd into project
- run bundle
- rake db:setup
- rails s
- visit localhost:3000
- play scissor-rock-paper until bored
